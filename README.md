# Overlay Component

This component provides the classes that are the overlays for PHP objects and functions. 
It is very helpful in developing testable code as you can mock these objects and functions.  

## Supported objects
- [DateTime](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php)
- [DOMDocument](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.domdocument.php)

## Supported functions
- [file_get_contents](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)
- [json_decode](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php)
- [json_encode](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php)
- [rand](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php)

## Tests
